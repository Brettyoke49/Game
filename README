Project description:
  This is the final project. Details I've added since project 5 are at the bottom of this README.

How to play:
  I don't have instructions within the game because that's part of the challenge, figuring out what to do (minus the controls). In order to win the game, you must kill the boss that floats at the top of the screen before you may fully kill the ghosts. Shooting a ghost before killing the boss will only result in it respawning. In order to win, kill the boss completely (10 bullets, indicated by health bar) and then kill all ghosts. If you can do that without losing all 3 of your lives (configuarable in xml) you win and a message will appear stating such.

Where I got my sprites and sounds:
  I made the ghost sprite.
  The skeleton sprite is from: https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack
  The trumpet sprite is from: https://jacobl14.wordpress.com/tag/8-bit-pringles/
  The boss sprite is from: https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/boulderdashex/sheet/93948/

  Trumpet sound bit: http://folk.uio.no/inf1040/lydfiler/trumpet.wav
  Music: https://ia801307.us.archive.org/8/items/AndrewGoldSpookyScarySkeletons/Andrew%20Gold%20-%20Spooky%20Scary%20Skeletons.mp3

Theme explanation:
  The theme overall is pretty obvious, but just in case you're not aware of why I included the trumpets or the chosen song, it's a reference to a fairly popular meme. Look up "doot doot" if you want to see examples.


Features added since project 5:
  Added god mode and indicative text

    To win: Kill boss so that you may kill the ghosts, otherwise ghosts will respawn.

  Added health bar for boss and life count for skeleton.
