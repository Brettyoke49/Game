Project description:
  This project implements a player object, a toggleable HUD, enemy "AI",
  and collision detection. The player can move left and right and jump. The HUD
  is configurable via the xml file (color, location, and size). A collision causes
  the player to dissapear for a brief time (death animations to be added later), and
  finally the AI simply means running away from the player when too close. I hope to
  do more with that as time goes on. I also added a death animation for player.

Where I got my sprites:
  I made the ghost sprite.
  The skeleton sprite is from: https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack

Final game level description:
  For the final game level, I plan on using the same sprites plus one more. I intend to
  add some kind of glowing ball (spirit kinda thing) that goes back and forth at the top of
  the screen. My idea is that killing a ghost only yields to two more spawning. In order for
  ghosts to stay dead, the orb object must first be killed. Ideally it will have health, and
  be somewhat difficult to hit (especially with the ghosts flying around).

  The game will conclude when all ghosts are dead, which should hopefully be sufficiently
  challenging. Losing all of your health/lives as a player will also end the game. Since the
  # of ghosts is configurable, the difficulty of the game is data driven.
