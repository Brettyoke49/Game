Project description:
  This project contains all of the changes laid out as required in paper.pdf.
That consists mostly of code beutification with minimal functional impact,
save for #6 and 8. For those I implemented parallax scrolling and a two way
multisprite class. I also updated the background and sprites to those I chose
/made.

Where I got my sprites:
I made the ghost sprite.
The skeleton sprite is from: https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack

I do plan on going back and making my own sprites instead of using others',
but I was a bit crunched for time for project 3 (as you can tell by the turn
in time).


How many backgrounds do I have:
2 backgrounds. One I mostly made, after finding the simple brick base online,
and the other being a realistic background to kind of juxtapose the pixelized
foreground. Taken from: http://getwallpapers.com/collection/scary-forest-wallpaper

What sprite did I create (not Sprite or MultiSprite):
Two Way MultiSprite


The easiest part of this project:
Adding = delete to two class' constructors.


Problems that I had in completing this project:

I struggled for a bit with coming up with a way to allow the specification of the number
of sprite instances desired in the xml spreadsheet. Making them spawn with different
velocities was easy, using rand. But coming up with an efficient way to make them in the
engine (especially since we had to use a vector of Drawable* objects) took me a little while.
