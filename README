Project no: 5

Project description:
  This project implements shooting, object pooling (for the bullets) and explosions for the
  enemy ghosts. The HUD has been adjusted to show that you can now shoot. Other than that the
  changes are fairly self explanatory, as it was just a matter of getting Dr. Malloy's code
  in line with mine, which only caused a few minor hiccups.

  Regarding the 8 bit trumpet that he shoots as "bullets", that is a reference to a popular
  meme called "mr skeltal" or "doot doot". While it looks a bit silly, it does fit in with
  the theme if you spend enough time on the internet. I may or may not change it later to
  something that fits better.

Where I got my sprites:
  I made the ghost sprite.
  The skeleton sprite is from: https://jesse-m.itch.io/skeleton-pack

Final game level description:
  For the final game level, I plan on using the same sprites plus one more. I intend to
  add some kind of glowing ball (spirit kinda thing) that goes back and forth at the top of
  the screen. My idea is that killing a ghost only yields to two more spawning. In order for
  ghosts to stay dead, the orb object must first be killed. Ideally it will have health, and
  be somewhat difficult to hit (especially with the ghosts flying around).

  The game will conclude when all ghosts are dead, which should hopefully be sufficiently
  challenging. Losing all of your health/lives as a player will also end the game. Since the
  # of ghosts is configurable, the difficulty of the game is data driven.

Features added since project 5:
  Added god mode and indicative text
  Added restart capabilities
  Added fast falling
  Added a boss and new way to win the game
    To win: Kill boss so that you may kill the ghosts, otherwise ghosts will respawn.
