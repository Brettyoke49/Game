Name: Brett Probert

How to play:
  I don't have instructions within the game because that's part of the challenge, figuring out what to do (minus the controls). 
  In order to win the game, you must kill the boss that floats at the top of the screen before you may fully kill the ghosts. 
  Shooting a ghost before killing the boss will only result in it respawning. In order to win, kill the boss completely (10 bullets, indicated by health bar) and then kill all ghosts. If you can do that without losing all 3 of your lives (configuarable in xml) you win and a message will appear stating such.

Where I got my sprites and sounds:
  I made the ghost sprite.
